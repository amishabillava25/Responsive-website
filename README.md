Task 4: Make a Website Mobile-Friendly Using CSS Media Queries

In this Task, I developed and enhanced a static desktop-only webpage into a fully responsive and mobile-friendly website using CSS media queries. I started by building the desktop layout with HTML for structure and CSS Flexbox for alignment, including sections like the navigation bar, hero image, and services section. After completing the desktop version, I implemented media queries targeting screens with a maximum width of 768px to optimize the layout for mobile devices. This included stacking elements vertically, resizing images and text, and adjusting padding and margins for better readability on smaller screens. I also ensured that images were responsive and fit well within containers without distortion. Finally, I used Chrome DevTools to test and debug the responsive design across various mobile devices and screen sizes, ensuring a smooth and consistent user experience on both desktop and mobile platforms.
